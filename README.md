# Hovering

Hovering is client gem to connect to Hover.com api to help read / update domain records. There is no official API support from Hover.com yet. This gem is piggybacking of the Hover's control_panel, which is really great. But sometimes you need to be able to update 50 nameserver records to point to new hosting - this when Hovering could help. Use at your own risk :-)

This was also an experiment to use parts of excellent [Trailblazer Framework](http://trb.to) outside of the context a web framework.

Thanks to [David Davis](https://github.com/daviddavis) and his [hover gem](https://github.com/daviddavis/hover). I used it as a starting point to explore Hover.com's API :-)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hovering'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
$ gem install hovering
```

## Usage

**Basic API Usage**


Connecting to Hover.com
```ruby
@client = Hovering::Client.new(username: "GendalfTheGrey",
                               password: 'Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen.')
```

Create a reusable Faraday connection after authenticating. It's a simple Faraday::Connection object and can be manipulated accordingly

```ruby
@client.connection #=> #<Faraday::Connection:0x00007fbf0f181750....
```
Default `get` will make a call to `https://www.hover.com/api/domains`. You can specify a different endpoint
```ruby
@client.connection&.get('dns')
```

For your convenience several get methods are provided directly through the Hovering::Client object

```ruby
@client.all_domains
@client.all_dns
@client.all_forwards
@client.all_mailboxes
```

## Support
If you run across a bug or want to submit a patch - they are always welcome and appreciated. If anybody has good ideas on how to test against a live Hover api, I would love any suggestions. Hover doesn't provide a test API :-(

## GEM / API Limitations
This gem can be used to retrieve and update basic DNS records of the domains you already purchased. It doesn't support buying new / transferring existing domains or manipulating mailboxes, other than getting a list of them. That is because Hover.com doesn't expose that functionality over API.

However you can update such things as A, CNAME, MX, etc records, and some properties of the domains, which is very useful once you have more than 5-10 domains to manage.

I don't use Mailboxes feature of Hover.com - so any help testing / developing that is appreciated. Right now gem just provides a basic read functionality for that feature.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
